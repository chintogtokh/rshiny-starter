# RShiny starter template


# Notes
* RShiny has a quirk where is *any* inputs or forms not used in RShiny are included (such as an errant search box), it will completely kill RShiny interactivity. Don't use non-RShiny inputs or forms. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/shiny-discuss/vd_nB-BH8sw
